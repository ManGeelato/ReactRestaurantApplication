/**React Restaurant Meals App**/

This is a restaurant meals app showing different dishes a restaurant got selling
run npm install to install all dependencies

Remember, for react-router-dom, Switch is now substituted by Routes so instead of Switch, use Routes
In this app, for styling we're using scss just to improve our styling knowledge even though we could have used bootstrap

We are using react hook, useContext to provide means to get data for different components through <AppContext.Provider> the mealdb as our API, link is : https://www.themealdb.com/api.php

Please Note, When you get to the API, you will see that some of the urls are written as "categories" and "random", In this app, I just changed the components names per say Categories is Dishes and Random is OtherMeals...It's all up to you, you can write them the way you want
